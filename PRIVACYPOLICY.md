Privacy Policy

Your privacy is our top priority. This VPN application is designed with a strict no-logs policy. We do not collect, store, or share any user data — ever.

No Logs. No Tracking. No Data Collection.
We do not collect any of the following:

No browsing history

No traffic data

No DNS queries

No IP addresses

No connection timestamps

No session duration

No bandwidth usage

No device identifiers

No personal information (name, email, phone number, etc.)

Your connection is your business. We have no interest in monitoring, recording, or analyzing it — and we technically can't.

No Third-Party Analytics or Ads
This app does not include any third-party advertising, analytics tools, or trackers. Your activity stays private from us and everyone else.

Security and Anonymity
We use strong encryption to protect your data in transit. Since we don’t log anything, there is nothing to leak — even under legal or technical pressure.

Children’s Privacy
This app is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect or store information from anyone, regardless of age.

Policy Updates
In the rare event we make changes to this privacy policy, we will notify users through the app or associated website.
